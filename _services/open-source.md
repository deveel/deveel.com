We are constantly focused on providing new and innovative solutions to the open-source community.

Here is the list of some of the projects and solutions developed over the time with the aim to be open and available to every developer.

## DeveelDB

Originally named _Minosse RDBMS_, this was the very first [SQL RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) created for the .NET framework, ath at the time of its creation was just at _beta_ stage. Consequently to the creation of _Deveel_, the project was renamed to follow the name of the company.
Along the time the project evolved alongside the .NET and Mono frameworks, pursuing the ambition to be portable among different operating systems and environments, focused on high performances and small footprint

**Note**: _The project is currently archived_

## CloudB

Experimenting with the new concepts of distributed computing and storage, [Antonello](/team/antonello-provenzano) developed a database system with a hybrid data-model, leveraging the sharding capabilities of networks.

In fact three different models were developed on top of the network engine: a Key/Value store model (_CloudBase_), a _new-SQL_ relational model (_CloudSQL_) and a graph-db model (_CloudGraph_).

The project had short life, given its _ahead of time_ nature and lack of resources to continue it.

## Deveel Math

This library was developed to address the poor capabilities of the .NET Framework to support _Astronomical Math_ (mathematics with more than 1 million decimals), given the need of such capability in data management projects, such as **DeveelDB** and **CloudB**.

Not an original work, since it was a port to .NET of the [Apache Harmony](https://harmony.apache.org/){ target:blank} _Math_ space.

**Note**: _The project is currently unmaintained_
