Our goal is to innovate the messaging and communication industry through new services and solutions

## Messaging Solutions

We are currently very focused on providing messaging solutions for enabling users to reach their customers in the most effective and secure way, through a simplified developer experience.

As such we are currently developing an _Omni-Channel Messaging_ service, that aims to reduce the number of intergrations and ad-hoc handling to messaging operators, providing a single point of access to multiple messaging channels (eg. _sms_, _e-mail_, _push_, etc.).

Please refer to the available documentation of the project
