Deveel was created at the beginning of the year 2001 as a personal effort by [Antonello Provenzano](/team/antonello-provenzano) to publish his open-source projects, and it consisted mostly of a brand and a name.

After few years (in 2011) a legal entity was formed and registered under the italian law (_Deveel IT Consultancy Services srl_), to offer professional services of consultancy to few international customers in Europe (primarily in France and Norway).

Deveel is still active and commited on providing innovative solutions to the open-source community, although without any commercial or financial aim.
